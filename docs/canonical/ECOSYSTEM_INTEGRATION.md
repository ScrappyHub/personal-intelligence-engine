## Integration rules

1. This repository must remain independently understandable, testable, buildable, and releasable.
2. Ecosystem integrations extend capability but do not replace standalone correctness.
3. Integrations use explicit, versioned schemas and receipts.
4. No undocumented database sharing, hidden filesystem coupling, or implicit trust is permitted.
5. Producer claims must be independently verified by the receiving boundary where verification is required.
6. Integration failure must not silently corrupt local authoritative state.
7. Missing upstream services must produce an explicit unavailable, unknown, deferred, or failed state according to the local contract.
8. This repository's current implementation must not be treated as the complete product definition.
